# Advent of Code 2021 - Bash

- Update December 22: since I don't have a lot of time to make these puzzles, I won't be able to make all of them (that's also why I only solve part 1).

My solution for Advent of Code 2021 in bash shell scripting as a freshman studying computer science.

The data.txt file is the data that's specifically for me. It won't give the correct output for you. You have to use your own data file which you get from Advent of Code.

My solutions are far from perfect. There will be lots of better ways to get the correct solution.
